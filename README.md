# Sorting Visualizer

this project is a visualizer for available and popular sorting algorithms.

I have bootstrapped this project with CRA's typescript template and have used the following packages:

| Package                  | Usage                                                                                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Typescript + React       | Used as the engine via which the application is rendered                                         |
| Mui Joy / Material       | Used for injecting color schemes (theme) into the application and highly customizable components |
| React Router + History@5 | Used for the routing of the application                                                          |
| SCSS                     | Used for styling the application                                                                 |
